## ✔️ Proposal
We propose LOCUS (Learning On-device Context and User-specific Schedules), a predictive cleaning system powered by On-device AI. Unlike traditional "reactive" robot vacuums that depend on rigid schedules, LOCUS establishes a "Proactive Partner" system that anticipates cleaning needs based on dynamic household contexts. The system comprehensively perceives the domestic environment by integrating multi-modal data—including home structure (Apple RoomPlan), visual context (YOLO), and audio context (YAMNet)—to interpret scenarios such as "dining" or "cooking". The core technology of LOCUS is the TimeSyncBuffer, which aligns asynchronous sensor streams to feed a GRU-based sequential model, enabling real-time prediction of contamination probabilities. Furthermore, LOCUS ensures complete privacy protection through strict edge computing and Personalized Federated Learning (FedPer), offering a smart home solution that adapts to user lifestyles without compromising sensitive data.
