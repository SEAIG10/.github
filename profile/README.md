## ✔️ Proposal
We propose AI-driven multi-chat system, ALIVE. ALIVE is a smart home solution that allows users to control appliances through everyday conversation. Users can register appliances and create chat rooms, allowing them to build a customized smart home environment. In chat rooms, users can freely communicate with their desired appliances using various interaction methods - from direct commands to indirect expressions, and even control multiple devices simultaneously.
The core technology of ALIVE is an AI-based chat system powered by Large Language Models (LLM). ALIVE leverages dialogue state tracking technology to understand the context and user intent, providing a more intuitive and personalized smart home experience.
